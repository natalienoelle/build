If you have time, it’s helpful to then apply these insights about the users to a current experience that is relevant to the problem at hand.

Use this journey to identify gaps in the experience that are disjointed for the user. Adding a row for “Opportunities” helps identify initial solutions to the problems identified by the users.

* Actions: what the user needs to do to move to the next step
* Questions: things the user needs answering before they’ll be willing to move to the next step
* Happy moments: positive, enjoyable things that improve the experience
* Pain points: frustrations and annoyances that spoil the experience
* Opportunities: design enhancements that you could implement in a new product, that address any of the problems identified.
